## Function Execution
THe GemFire API provides classes to implement and register Functions deployed to cache servers that may be invoked remotely by member applications, typically cache clients. Functions may execute in parallel, distributed among multiple servers, combining results in a map-reduce pattern or may be targeted to a single server. A Function execution may be also be targeted to a specific region.
